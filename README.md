# Rotor blade balancer
Rotor blade balancer for autogyro rotors is passive device. It allows precise determination a two-dimensional position of rotor blade center of gravity.

The blade balancer is used in that way:

1. The balancer needs to be levelled to avoid a systematic error.
2. A rotor blade is inserted under blade balancer scale
3. The rotor blade needs to be balanced to level by sliding the blade in longitudal direction. The level is marked by level bubbles on the balancer sides.
4. The actual Plumb line is marked by pencil around the balancer scale
5. Tho rotor blade is flipped to symmetric possition by sliding to 90 degrees.  (The two triangles supporting the blade should rotate around screws)
6. The rotor blade needs to be balanced again by sliding. The new plumb line ortogonal to previous need to be marked by pencil.
7. Rotor blade COG is located under intersection of the two lines.
